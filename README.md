I'm Jamie. Last year I complete a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at the University of Reading after gaining a passion for the excitingly ever evolving field during A-Levels. During my
studies, I covered a wide variety of topics, which culminated in my final year project which was a simulation to teach users about soil and crop management techniques. Despite the topic of
 the simulation not being my area of expertise, I successfully overcame that challenge and attained a high 2:1. Following graduation, I took a year to  decide what career path was right for 
me. During this time, I volunteered with AgeUK where I assisted clients with technical problems, and cultivated their understanding of technology. Once I learned about DevOps and researched 
what the role entails it really appealed to me since it made use of software development skills without having to be full time developer. Being a bridge between the Developer and Operation teams also sounded very rewarding. With the combination
of my excellent hard and soft skills I'd be a perfect fit for the role, and I am 
eager to put these skills into practise with Sparta's clients.
